# Machine Learning Projects


This notebook contains different machine learning projects I have experimented with. 

The first project completed was on the MNIST dataset where I was trying to predict and classify handwritten digits. The final accuracy of the model was around 97%.

The second project completed was on Audiobook data where I was trying to predict whether or not a customer would be a returning customer. The notebook can be found either through this <a href="https://github.com/JeremyBrent/ML_Projects/tree/master/Audiobooks_classification"> link </a> or by navigating the notebook manually.
