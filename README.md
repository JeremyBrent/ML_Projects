# Machine Learning Projects


This notebook contains different machine learning projects I have experimented with and are derived from various Udemy courses I have taken. This repository is 'living' and will continue to grow as a learn more algorithms. The purpose of this repository is to have general ML model algorithms in a centralized location for easy implementation in future projects.  

The first project completed was on the MNIST dataset where I was predicting and classifying handwritten digits. The final accuracy of the model was around 97%. The notebook can be found either through this <a href="https://github.com/JeremyBrent/ML_Projects/tree/master/MNIST"> link </a> or by navigating the notebook manually.

The second project completed was on Audiobook data where I was predicting whether or not a customer would be a returning customer. The notebook can be found either through this <a href="https://github.com/JeremyBrent/ML_Projects/tree/master/Audiobooks_classification"> link </a> or by navigating the notebook manually.

The third project that I am currently working on contains standard files that can be reused for preprocessing and future machine learning pipelines. ML models include regression algorithms, classifcation algorithms, and NLP algorithms.
